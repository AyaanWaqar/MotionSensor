# PIR Motion Sensor
I developed various projects using motion sensors with Arduino to detect and respond to movement, setting a practical foundation for security applications. By integrating a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor with the Arduino, I programmed it to sense infrared energy changes, which occur when a person or object moves within its range. This setup allowed the Arduino to trigger actions, like activating an alarm or lighting, upon detecting motion. This technology has practical implications in security systems, where motion sensors can monitor entry points and send alerts, enhancing surveillance and safety in residential or commercial spaces.
